Add autocogs to package descriptions
Add htmlwidgets to package descriptions

Add dataset help descriptions

look at all TODO values before submission
  move all labels of figures to the top of the figure before the includegraphics
  scatter plot -> scatterplot
  dataset -> data set
  alpha sort all abbreviations and glossary items
  fix all missing references
  p-value -> p value
  matricies -> matrices
  remove runtime ?
  \frenchspacing ? - no
  chapter -> Chapter
  ~\ref{}
  ~\cite{}
  from top to bottom in pages, work on spacing so the code is next to the figure.




\section{Summary}
  talked about X
  talked about what you can do with X
  motivate how X works with the next Chapter

  summary
    ggduo only works for small datasets
      trelliscope can scale up to the larger data sets




## Jiasen's Thesis Format

* Intro (40-50 of textbook like information)
  * Start from very basics, as if I don't know anything
  * Provide motivation
* Background
* Lit review (or in each chapter)
* Chapters
* Closer
  * How to combine to make a super project
* Appendix
  * attach pdf manuals of R packages

# Jiasen's info

* Sections
  * Introduction
    * why impactful
    * why important
    * contributions
    * organization
      * mini abstract for each chapters
  * Background (bigger)
    * Should all be existing things
    * Should very familiar for anyone in the field, but not familiar for people outside
    * Show how much you know about the area
    * Statistician should be able to understand quickly
    * Filled with links to papers and sites
  * Contributions
    * can be independent
  * Conclusions
    * Why impactful
    * Future direction

* \chapter{Regular chapter}
  * \section{Summary}
    * talked about X
    * talked about what you can do with X
    * motivate how X works with the next Chapter




github:
% \subsection{\GGally}
%   implement matrix manipulations for ggmatrix
%     be able to subset a ggmatrix and produce a new ggmatrix
%     be able to insert a ggmatrix into a valid location
%   remove all options of labels
%
% \subsection{\autocogs}
%   Add cognostics for time series data
%   Add safety layer for the execution (try catch)
%   Add message similar to $facet_map$ to submit them to github
%   Add more pkg layer connections: rbokeh, plotly
%
% \subsection{\gqlr}
%   Add safety layer for each field's execution (try catch)
%   Explore more working examples rather than proof of concept
%   Add integration with trelliscopejs
