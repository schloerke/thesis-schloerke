Add links to each package in package description page

Move all "background" chapters inside each bigger chapter (3 big sections)

add intro
  2-3 paragraphs for each major section
  include a "final" picture for each section
  include a hierarchy tree for all chapters of information (graphviz)

add conclusion
  couple paragraphs?

  add a future work section
    ~ 3 pages in total. Not too much.
    take a step back and talk about broader topics.  This would be "I've talked a lot about graphics... graphics today are missing blah blah blah interactivity and crosstalk and cohesive environments"
  should be shorter than intro

after done with intro / conclusion
  add "index" enumerate of each major package of mine
