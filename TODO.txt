look at all TODO values before submission
  scatter plot -> scatterplot
  dataset -> data set
  alpha sort all abbreviations and glossary items
  p value -> p-value
  from top to bottom in pages, work on spacing so the code is next to the figure.




\section{Summary}
  talked about X
  talked about what you can do with X
  motivate how X works with the next Chapter

  summary
    ggduo only works for small datasets
      trelliscope can scale up to the larger data sets


add intro
  2-3 paragraphs for each major section
  include a "final" picture for each section
  include a hierarchy tree for all chapters of information (graphviz)

add conclusion
  couple paragraphs?

  add a future work section
    ~ 3 pages in total. Not too much.
    take a step back and talk about broader topics.  This would be "I've talked a lot about graphics... graphics today are missing blah blah blah interactivity and crosstalk and cohesive environments"
  should be shorter than intro
