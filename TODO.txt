Add figures to all plots
  refer to all figures instead of above / below
    include proper references to the next line with \fig{fig:geom_point}
  << geom_point, fig.cap="testtest", fig.pos="H" >>=
  plot(1:10, 1:10)

cognostics
  Future work
    Add cognostics for time series data
    Add safety layer for the execution (try catch)
    Add message similar to $facet_map$ to submit them to github
    Add rbokeh layer connections
    Add plotly layer connections



\section{Summary}
  talked about X
  talked about what you can do with X
  motivate how X works with the next Chapter

  The following intro doesn't necessaraly need to integrate with the prior chapter

  summary
    ggduo only works for small datasets
      trelliscope can scale up to the larger data sets

  Intro
    trelliscope is built to handle all types of data sizes when faceting on variables.

GraphQL
  ? Introduction paragraph
  - conclusion / wrap up paragraph


Autocogs background
  add pictures to filtering

add intro
  2-3 paragraphs for each major section
  include a "final" picture for each section
  include a hierarchy tree for all chapters of information (graphviz)

add conclusion
  couple paragraphs?

  add a future work section
    ~ 3 pages in total. Not too much.
    take a step back and talk about broader topics.  This would be "I've talked a lot about graphics... graphics today are missing blah blah blah interactivity and crosstalk and cohesive environments"
  should be shorter than intro

after done with intro / conclusion
  add "index" enumerate of each major package of mine
