%  This is the BibTeX data file for a simple, example thesis.
%
%  I like to order the entries by author, and within author by year.
%  If, for example, I later added a second 1994 publication for Goossens,
%  I would give it the key, ``Goossens:1994b''.

 abstract = "ggplot2 A grammar of graphics is a tool that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic. Such a grammar allows us to move beyond named graphics (e.g., the â€œscatterplotâ€) and gain insight into the deep structure that underlies statistical graphics. This article builds on Wilkinson, Anand, and Grossman (2005), describing extensions and refinements developed while building an open source implementation of the grammar of graphics for R, ggplot2 . The topics in this article include an introduction to the grammar by working through the process of creating a plot, and discussing the components that we need. The grammar is then presented formally and compared to Wilkinsonâ€™s grammar, highlighting the hierarchy of defaults, and the implications of embedding a graphical grammar into a programming language. The power of the grammar is illustrated with a selection of examples that explore different components and their interactions, in more detail. The article concludes by discussing some perceptual issues, and thinking about how we can build on the grammar to learn how to create graphical â€œpoems.â€ Supplemental materials are available online.",

abstract={Trelliscope emanates from the Trellis Display framework for visualization and the Divide and Recombine (D&R) approach to analyzing large complex data. In Trellis, the data are broken up into subsets, a visualization method is applied to each subset, and the display result is an array of panels, one per subset. This is a powerful framework for visualization of data, both small and large. In D&R, the data are broken up into subsets, and any analytic method from statistics and machine learning is applied to each subset independently. Then the outputs are recombined. This provides not only a powerful framework for analysis, but also feasible and practical computations using distributed computational facilities. It enables deep analysis of the data: study of both data summaries as well as the detailed data at their finest granularity. This is critical to full understanding of the data. It also enables the analyst to program using an interactive high-level language for data analysis such as R, which allows the analyst to focus more on the data and less on code. In this paper we introduce Trelliscope, a system that scales Trellis to large complex data. It provides a way to create displays with a very large number of panels and an interactive viewer that allows the analyst to sort, filter, and sample the panels in a meaningful way. We discuss the underlying principles, design, and scalable architecture of Trelliscope, and illustrate its use on three analysis projects in proteomics, high intensity physics, and power systems engineering.},
